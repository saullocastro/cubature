What is Cubature?
-----------------

It is a numerical integration technique.  From MathWorld
http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Cubature.html, Ueberhuber (1997, p. 71) and
Krommer and Ueberhuber (1998, pp. 49 and 155-165) use the word "quadrature" to
mean numerical computation of a univariate integral, and "cubature" to mean
numerical computation of a multiple integral.

Cubature for Python
-------------------

This is a wrapper to Prof. Steven Johnson's C package, available at https://github.com/stevengj/cubature.
The current version is a wrapper to version 1.0.4 of Prof. Johnson's package.

Documentation
-------------

Please, see the module documentation here http://saullocastro.github.io/cubature.

Python wrapper for the Cubature package
---------------------------------------

From the Nanostructures and Computation Wiki at MIT
http://ab-initio.mit.edu/wiki/index.php/Cubature, Steven W. Johnson
http://math.mit.edu/~stevenj has written a simple C package for adaptive
multidimensional integration (cubature) of vector-valued functions over
hypercubes and this is a Python wrapper for the referred C package.

Installation from source code
-----------------------------

You must have Cython installed. Then do:

```
python setup.py install 
```

or (usually in Linux):

```
python3 setup.py install
```

Installation from pip repository
--------------------------------

Just do:

```
python -m pip install cubature
```

or (usually in Linux):

```
python3 -m pip install cubature
```

Running the tests
-----------------

To run the tests you will have to download the source code. After installing as
explained above, go to the source code root folder and run:

```
py.test .
```

The Python wrapper has been proven using test integrands from the C
package and some additional testing functions from Genz. The integrands
were implemented in Cython and verified with Mathematica.
